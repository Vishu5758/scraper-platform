# Scraper Platform

This repository hosts the scraper platform codebase, including multiple agent orchestrators, Airflow DAGs, and supporting utilities. For an overview of the architecture, quickstart instructions, and component-level docs, see the files under `docs/`.

Key entry points:
- `docs/README.md`: Documentation index and onboarding pointers.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`: High-level system design.
- `config/agents/`: Agent configuration defaults and pipelines.
- `dags/`: Airflow DAGs for orchestrating scraping workflows.

If you are upgrading from a previous drop that included additional status reports, those documents have been restored here for reference and should be updated as needed during releases.
